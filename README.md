# runescape-quest-saver
Disclaimer: This is just a test to improve my ASPNetCore proficiency, this is not meant to be used by anyone. This program is also built using experimental preview builds of .NET

This program is used to organize your Runescape 3 questing experience. Look up quests, check requirements, and save a quest list to refer to later. 

The logical section of this program used .NET 5.0 with the HTML Agility Pack library [HAP] (https://html-agility-pack.net/)

The GUI of this program is built in .NET 6.0 Preview 7 along with WebView2 to create a website-like appearance all within a window's application. To run this program you will need .NET Desktop Runtime 6.0.0-preview.7 (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) and WebView 2 (https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section). I personally used Visual Studio 2022 and installed .NET MAUI (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation)
